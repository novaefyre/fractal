My goal today is to do some research on fractal generation and to import the gui jar so I can start 
experimenting. Tomorrow I want to continue working on the basic setup, creating the classes I will need to make 
this work.

Today, I got a screen up, and worked on the first Fractal class (PythTree). Tomorrow, I'm going to try to get 
PythTree to show up on the screen, and, if i manage that, ensure it works as intended. The next step will be 
developing a UI, and finally adding more fractals.

I can make one rectangle appear on screen, but I don't know how to make more. I might need help. I'm trying to 
make a composite shape out of multiple component shapes, and I barely understand what little help I can find 
online.

So... it doesn't throw any exceptions anymore, but it still doesn't work. I tried using Area, ArrayLists of 
shapes, and drawing directly to a Graphics2D object. Nothing worked correctly, if at all. I'm honestly not sure 
what to do now.
