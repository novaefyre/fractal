My goal today is to do some research on fractal generation and to import the gui jar so I can start 
experimenting. Tomorrow I want to continue working on the basic setup, creating the classes I will need to make 
this work.

Today, I got a screen up, and worked on the first Fractal class (PythTree). Tomorrow, I'm going to try to get 
PythTree to show up on the screen, and, if i manage that, ensure it works as intended. The next step will be 
developing a UI, and finally adding more fractals.

I can make one rectangle appear on screen, but I don't know how to make more. I might need help. I'm trying to 
make a composite shape out of multiple component shapes, and I barely understand what little help I can find 
online.

So... it doesn't throw any exceptions anymore, but it still doesn't work. I tried using Area, ArrayLists of 
shapes, and drawing directly to a Graphics2D object. Nothing worked correctly, if at all. I'm honestly not sure 
what to do now.

My fractal shows up on screen now. It even creates the correct number of shapes! now I just need to figure out 
how to get each shape in the correct spot. After I fix that, I'll be done with the first fractal. I'm going to 
make a UI when the Pythagoras Tree is done, and when the UI is complete, I'll make 2-3 more fractals (depending 
on how much time and inclination I have left).

Getting each part of the fractal in the right place is a lot harder than I thought it would be. My previous 
plan remains, but I may need more time and /or help to finish PythTree.
