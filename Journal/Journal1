My goal today is to do some research on fractal generation and to import the gui jar so I can start 
experimenting. Tomorrow I want to continue working on the basic setup, creating the classes I will need to make 
this work.

Today, I got a screen up, and worked on the first Fractal class (PythTree). Tomorrow, I'm going to try to get 
PythTree to show up on the screen, and, if i manage that, ensure it works as intended. The next step will be 
developing a UI, and finally adding more fractals.
